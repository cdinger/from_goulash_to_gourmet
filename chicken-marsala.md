## Ingredients

- 4 chicken breasts, boneless and
- Marsala wine (½ to 1 C.)
- skinless
- Chicken broth (¼ to ½ C.)
- 1 T. olive oil
- Fresh mushrooms, sliced (about ½
- 1 T. butter
- pound)
- Flour

## Preparation

Pound chicken breasts until about ¼ inch and even.  Season with salt and pepper.  Dredge in flour and shake off excess.  Brown in oil and butter.  Remove from skillet and cover to keep warm.  Add mushrooms to skillet and cook until juices are released (then I add about 1-2 tsp. minced garlic and cook for about 1 min.).

Add broth and wine and simmer for a min.  Add chicken breasts just to heat and sauce thickens slightly.  Serve with buttered rice or linguine.
